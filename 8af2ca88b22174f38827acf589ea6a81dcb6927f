But that\u0027s just a side note.",

      "message": "You probably misunderstood my previous comment.\nBreaking the test to several test methods doesn\u0027t mean  extracting it to a private method. It means that each test is a separate public method marked with @Test. \nIt also should not be called from the first test method here.\nThat way, each one is an independent test and is called separately by the testing framework.\nI hope it\u0027s more clear now.",
