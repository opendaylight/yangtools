/**
 * An argument to a YANG statement, as defined by section 6.1.3 of both
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020#section-6.1.3">RFC6020</a> and
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7950#section-6.1.3">RFC7950</a>. An argument is effectively any old string,
 * except it can be defined in a number of ways:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>it can be a simple unquoted string, or</li>
 *   <li>it can be a single-quoted string, with its contents being completely preserved, or</li>
 *   <li>it can be a double-quoted string, which defines some escaping and whitespace-stripping rules, or</li>
 *   <li>it can be a concatenation of any number of single- or double-quoted strings</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The first three cases as covered by {@link Single} subclass, which exposes appropriate methods to infer how its
 * string literal is to be interpreted. The last case is handled by {@link Concatenation} subclass, which exposes
 * the constituent parts as {@link Single} items.
 *
 * <p>
 * Please note that parser implementations producing these argument representations are <b>NOT</b> required to retain
 * the format of the original definition. They are free to perform quoting and concatenation transformations as long as
 * they maintain semantic equivalence. As a matter of example, these transformations are explicitly allowed:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>elimination of unneeded quotes, for example turning {@code "foo"} into {@code foo}</li>
 *   <li>transformation of quotes, for example turning {@code "foo\nbar"} into {@code 'foo&#10bar'}</li>
 *   <li>concatenation processing, for example turning {@code 'foo' + 'bar'} into {@code foobar}</li>
 * </ul>
