 * FIXME: this interface needs to be moved into .spi, but due to classpath funkyness
 *        of OSGi, that change has to be carefully orchestrated to ensure proper imports
 *        exist in all generated pacakges. One avenue how to achieve that is to move
 *        {@link YangModuleInfo} and modify code generator to add a static field
 *        to all generated classes which will point to the per-model YangModuleInfo
 *        (currently all users of it have to walk the package hierarchy, so that
 *        is an improvement in and of itself).
