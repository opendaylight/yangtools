/**
 * A very basic data tree node. It has a version (when it was last modified), a subtree version (when any of its
 * children were modified) and some read-only data.
 *
 * <p>
 * Semantic difference between these two is important when dealing with modifications involving parent/child
 * relationships and what operations can be execute concurrently without creating a data dependency conflict.
 *
 * <p>
 * A replace/delete operation cannot be applied to this node if the subtree version does not match. This mismatch
 * still allows modifications to its descendants.
 *
 * <p>
 * A mismatch in node version indicates a replacement, preventing a modification of descendants or itself.
