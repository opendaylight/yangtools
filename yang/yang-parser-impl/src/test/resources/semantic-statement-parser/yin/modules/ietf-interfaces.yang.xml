      <description>
        <text>The list of configured interfaces on the device.

The operational state of an interface is available in the
/interfaces-state/interface list.  If the configuration of a
system-controlled interface cannot be used by the system
(e.g., the interface hardware present does not match the
interface type), then the configuration is not applied to
the system-controlled interface shown in the
/interfaces-state/interface list.  If the the configuration
of a user-controlled interface cannot be used by the system,
the configured interface is not instantiated in the
/interfaces-state/interface list.</text>
      </description>
      <leaf name="name">
        <type name="string"/>
        <description>
          <text>The name of the interface.

A device MAY restrict the allowed values for this leaf,
possibly depending on the type of the interface.

For system-controlled interfaces, this leaf is the
device-specific name of the interface.  The 'config false'
list /interfaces-state/interface contains the currently
existing interfaces on the device.

If a client tries to create configuration for a
system-controlled interface that is not present in the
/interfaces-state/interface list, the server MAY reject
the request, if the implementation does not support
pre-provisioning of interfaces, or if the name refers to
an interface that can never exist in the system.  A
NETCONF server MUST reply with an rpc-error with the
error-tag 'invalid-value' in this case.

If the device supports pre-provisioning of interface
configuration, the feature 'pre-provisioning' is
advertised.

If the device allows arbitrarily named user-controlled
interfaces, the feature 'arbitrary-names' is advertised.

When a configured user-controlled interface is created by
the system, it is instantiated with the same name in the
/interface-state/interface list.  Since the name in that
list MAY be mapped to ifName by an implementation, such an
implementation MUST restrict the allowed values for this
leaf so that it matches the restrictions of ifName.

If a NETCONF server that implements this restriction is
sent a value that doesn't match the restriction, it MUST
reply with an rpc-error with the error-tag
'invalid-value'.</text>
        </description>
      </leaf>
      <leaf name="description">
        <type name="string"/>
        <description>
          <text>A textual description of the interface.

This leaf MAY be mapped to ifAlias by an implementation.
Such an implementation MUST restrict the allowed values
for this leaf so that it matches the restrictions of
ifAlias.

If a NETCONF server that implements this restriction is
sent a value that doesn't match the restriction, it MUST
reply with an rpc-error with the error-tag
'invalid-value'.

Since ifAlias is defined to be stored in non-volatile
storage, the MIB implementation MUST map ifAlias to the
value of 'description' in the persistently stored
datastore.

Specifically, if the device supports ':startup', when
ifAlias is read the device MUST return the value of
'description' in the 'startup' datastore, and when it is
written, it MUST be written to the 'running' and 'startup'
datastores.  Note that it is up to the implementation if
it modifies this single leaf in 'startup', or if it
performs an implicit copy-config from 'running' to
'startup'.

If the device does not support ':startup', ifAlias MUST
be mapped to the 'description' leaf in the 'running'
datastore.</text>

        <description>
          <text>The type of the interface.

When an interface entry is created, a server MAY
initialize the type leaf with a valid value, e.g., if it
is possible to derive the type from the name of the
interface.

If a client tries to set the type of an interface to a
value that can never be used by the system, e.g., if the
type is not supported or if the type does not match the
name of the interface, the server MUST reject the request.
A NETCONF server MUST reply with an rpc-error with the
error-tag 'invalid-value' in this case.</text>

Systems that implement the IF-MIB use the value of this
leaf in the 'running' datastore to set
IF-MIB.ifAdminStatus to 'up' or 'down' after an ifEntry
has been initialized, as described in RFC 2863.

Changes in this leaf in the 'running' datastore are
reflected in ifAdminStatus, but if ifAdminStatus is
changed over SNMP, this leaf is not affected.</text>
