 * FIXME: 6.0.0: consider yang-data-api integration
 *
 * The above note does not give the subject enough attention. RFC8528 redefines the YANG data metamodel is significant
 * ways in that it ties it with RFC8525/RFC7895. The content of 'schema-mounts' is critical to interpreting
 * inter-mountpoint data, notably in XML/JSON parsers, which need to be able to correctly infer their mode of
 * encapsulation (nested mount points).
 *
 * Integration with DataTree is questionable here, as MountPointNode has enough information for InMemoryDataTree to
 * operate efficiently -- all it needs to is switch the resolution root.
 *
 * On the other hand, requiring that a YANG data world is identified by MountPointIdentifer (which is QName) adds
 * interpretation flexibility to SchemaContext which is currently hard-coded. For example operations which require
 * encapsulation of an entire tree have to assume that a SchemaContext has a NodeIdentifier which it uses for the name
 * of its top-level node. MountPointIdentifier solves this, as it can easily be converted to a unique world identifier.
 *
 * That allows, for example NETCONF to specify the root data identifier, properly matching the data it receives from
 * the device to the native datastore format. Rehosting root identifier means rehosting top-level nodes of
 * a ContainerNode, which is a simple and relatively-inexpensive operation (i.e. O(N) where N is the number of
 * top-level nodes).
 *
 * To support this case, MountPointContext really wants to be Identifiable<MountPointIdentifier>, where it would also
 * provide a 'default NodeIdentifier getRootIdentifier()' method. In PathArgument contexts, MountPointIdentifier is
 * directly usable anyway.
