/**
 * Extension to the NormalizedNodeStreamWriter with metadata support. Semantically this extends the event model of
 * {@link NormalizedNodeStreamWriter} with two new events:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #startMetadata(int)} is within the scope of any open node and starts a block of metadata entries. It
 * is recommended to emit this block before any other events. Only
 * {@link #startMetadataEntry(QName, AnnotationSchemaNode)} and {@link NormalizedNodeStreamWriter#endNode()} are valid
 * in this node. This event may be emitted at most once for any open node.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link #startMetadataEntry(QName, AnnotationSchemaNode)} to start a metadata entry. Its value is must be emitted
 * via {@link NormalizedNodeStreamWriter#nodeValue(Object)} before the entry is closed via
 * {@link NormalizedNodeStreamWriter#endNode()}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that some implementations of this interface, notably those targeting streaming XML, may require metadata to
 * be emitted before any other events. Such requirement is communicated through {@link #requireMetadataFirst()} and
 * users must honor it. If such requirement is not set, metadata may be emitted at any time.
 *
 * <p>
 * Furthermore implementations targeting RFC7952 encoding towards external systems are required to handle metadata
 * attached to {@code leaf-list} and {@code list} nodes by correctly extending them to each entry.
