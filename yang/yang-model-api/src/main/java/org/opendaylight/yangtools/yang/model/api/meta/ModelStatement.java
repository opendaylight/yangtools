 * Model statement

 * <li>{@link DeclaredStatement} - Statement representation as was defined in original
 * source. This representation could be used during computation of effective model
 * or during transforming YANG model from one serialization format to other.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link EffectiveStatement} - Representation of effective statement - this
 * statement may be different from declared, in such way, that it contains additional
 * substatements, provides access to model namespaces. Some effective statements may be not
 * directly declared in YANG source, but could be inferred by semantic processing of
 * other statements (eg. uses, augment).
 * </li>
 * </ul>
