/**
 * Interface describing YANG 'grouping' statement.

 * It is used to define a reusable block of nodes, which may be used locally in
 * the module, in modules that include it, and by other modules that import from it.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: this interface extends {@link AddedByUsesAware}, but this contradicts the javadoc of {@link #isAddedByUses()},
 *       as groupings can never be encountered in 'data schema node' context. It is their children, which are data
 *       schema node, but those really are instantiated and typically differ in {@link #getQName()}'s namespace.
