      "message": "aside from the instanceof checks, these tests should also verify that JSON the entire codec works correctly, i.e. that payload parsing and serialization works.\n\n- lhotka02 needs to validate the JSON output is not quoted and JSON input is accepted when not quoted\n- rfc7951 needs to validate that JSON output is quouted and that JSON input is accepted *both* quoted and unquoted\n\nAccepting RFC7951 unquoted input is important for backwards compatibility with previous releases -- i.e. if something was serialized with a previous release, we must not suddenly start rejecting it.",
