// FIXME: sealed when we have JDK17+
// FIXME: This interface ignores a number of complications when dealing with external forms. For one, it assumes
//        a serdes operation does not have further context than the input -- and this is seldom the case. The other
//        failing is that it actively discourages use of checked exceptions to deal with errors at the appropriate
//        level. Based on these, this interface is deprecated for removal without a replacement. Users are
//        encouraged to define similar interface fitting their needs.
