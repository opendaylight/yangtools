# YANG-opinionated object model of an [XPath 1.0 expression](https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/)

This component defines an object model, rooted in org.opendaylight.yangtools.yang.xpath.api.YangXPathExpression.
Instances of such expressions can be acquired via an implementation of
org.opendaylight.yangtools.yang.xpath.api.YangXPathParser, which in turn are given out from an implementation of
org.opendaylight.yangtools.yang.xpath.api.YangXPathParserFactory.
