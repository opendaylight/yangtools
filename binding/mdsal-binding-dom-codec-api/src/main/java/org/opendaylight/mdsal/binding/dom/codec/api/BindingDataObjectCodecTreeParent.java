/**
 * Common interface for entities which can supply a {@link BindingDataObjectCodecTreeNode} based on Binding DataObject
 * class instance.
 *
 * @param <T> Dummy parameter to work around problems with streaming {@link ChoiceIn} classes. Essentially we want
 *            {@link #getStreamChild(Class)} to also service such classes, which are not {@link DataObject}s. The
 *            problem really is that {@code case} interfaces are DataObjects and hence are an alluring target for that
 *            method. The workaround works with two sides:
 *            <ul>
 *              <li>Here the fact that we are generic means that binary compatibility dictates that our signature be
 *                  backwards compatible with anyone who might have seen us as non-generic, i.e. in streamChild() taking
 *                  a raw class (because there were no generics)</li>
 *              <li>Users pick it up from there: all they need to do is to go to raw types, then accepts any class, but
 *                  from there we can just chain on method return, arriving into a type-safe world again</li>
 *            </ul>

// FIXME: Now the above documentation is fine and dandy, but can we adjust the shape of our classes somehow?
//        The problem seems to be grouping interfaces, which are pulling in 'DataObject' to the picture and thus
//        and up marking case statements even if we do not mark them specially. If we could disconnect concrete cases
//        from DataObject in a civil manner, then we could go the DataObject -> ChoiceIn -> CaseOf and not have
//        choice/case statements in the picture. But what would that do to all the concepts hanging off of DataObject?
