      "message": "Continuing the comment, this is where it becomes important.\n\nThe equivalent of what YangDataStatement does should be achievable via a pure third-party extension, without making changes across the stack.\n\nI do not have an immediate answer for what to exactly do here -- we need to figure out why we are forced to even known of YangDataStatement here and what other options we have in addressing the concerns without polluting this class with that extension.\n\nUntil we do, we must not pollute model.api.stmt and it is preferable to have this class tangled to YangDataStatementImpl.",
