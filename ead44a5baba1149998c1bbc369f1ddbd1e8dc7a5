      "message": "You didn\u0027t put me off. I actually initially intended to remove the var but when I did context assist in eclipse I expected to see a clear() method and, failing to see that, I thought set(null) was the way to clear/remove it. I didn\u0027t see the remove() method. \n\nBut thinking about it more:\n\nI think the TL uses an internal map, in which case I would think #set(null) would just store a null value and leave the map entry. Since this class is used with an executor, leaving the map entry should be fine as the thread(s) will likely either be re-used or expire. So #set(null) is probably more efficient than #remove as the next non-null #set won\u0027t have to create a new entry. \n\nI\u0027m leaning towards changing it back. What do you think?",
