/**
 * Immutable Object - object does not change its state during lifecycle.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Marker interface for objects which are immutable. This interface should be
 * used directly on objects, preferably final, which are eligible for the
 * JSR-305 @Immutable annotation and objects implementing this interface are
 * required to abide to interface contract specified by @Immutable. 
 * 
 * <p>The reason for the existence of this interface is twofold: 
 * unlike @Immutable, it is
 * visible at runtime and objects can be quickly checked for compliance using a
 * quick 'instanceof' check. This is useful for code which needs to capture a
 * point-in-time snapshot of otherwise unknown objects -- a typical example
 * being logging/tracing systems. Such systems would normally have to rely on
 * serializing the object to get a stable checkpoint. Objects marked with this
 * interface are guaranteed to remain stable, thus already being a checkpoint
 * for all intents and purposes, so aside from retaining a reference no further
 * action on them is necessary.
 * 
 * Implementations of this interface must not change any public state during
 * their whole lifecycle.
 * 
 * This interface is mutually exclusive with {@link Mutable} and other
 * {@link MutationBehaviour}s.
