     * Creates an ExecutorService with a specified bounded queue capacity that favors creating new
     * threads over queuing, as the former is faster, so threads will only be reused when the thread
     * limit is exceeded and tasks are queued. If the maximum queue capacity is reached, subsequent
     * tasks will be rejected.
     *
     * <p>For example, if the maximum number of threads is 100 and 100 short-lived tasks are submitted
     * within say 10 seconds, then 100 threads will be created and used - previously constructed
     * idle threads will not be reused. This provides the fastest execution of the 100 tasks at the
     * expense of memory and thread resource overhead. Therefore it is advisable to specify a
     * relatively small thread limit (probably no more than 50).
     *
     * <p>Threads that have not been used for 15 seconds are terminated and removed from the pool.
     * Thus, a pool that remains idle for long enough will not consume any resources.
     *
     * <p>If you need an executor with less memory and thread resource overhead where slower execution
     * time is acceptable, consider using {@link #newBoundedCachedThreadPool }.
