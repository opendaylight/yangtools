/**
 * An implementation of ListeningExecutorService that attempts to detect deadlock scenarios that
 * could occur if clients invoke the returned Future's <code>get</code> methods synchronously.
 *
 * <p>Deadlock scenarios are most apt to occur with a backing single-threaded executor where setting of
 * the Future's result is executed on the single thread. Here's a scenario:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Client code is currently executing in an executor's single thread.</li>
 * <li>The client submits another task to the same executor.</li>
 * <li>The client calls <code>get()</code> synchronously on the returned Future</li>
 * </ul>
 * The second submitted task will never execute since the single thread is currently executing
 * the client code which is blocked waiting for the submitted task to complete. Thus, deadlock has
 * occurred.
 *
 * <p>This class prevents this scenario via the use of a ThreadLocal variable. When a task is invoked,
 * the ThreadLocal is set and, when a task completes, the ThreadLocal is cleared. Futures returned
 * from this class override the <code>get</code> methods to check if the ThreadLocal is set. If it is,
 * an ExecutionException is thrown with a custom cause.
 *
 * <p>Note that the ThreadLocal is not removed automatically, so some state may be left hanging off of
 * threads which have encountered this class. If you need to clean that state up, use
 * {@link #cleanStateForCurrentThread()}.
