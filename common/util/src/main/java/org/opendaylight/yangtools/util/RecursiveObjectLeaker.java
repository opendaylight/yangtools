/**
 * Thread-local hack to make recursive extensions work without too much hassle. The idea is that prior to instantiating
 * an extension, the definition object checks whether it is already present on the stack, recorded object is returned.
 *
 * If it is not, it will push itself to the stack as unresolved and invoke the constructor. The constructor's lowermost
 * class calls to this class and if the topmost entry is not resolved, it will leak itself.
 *
 * Upon return from the constructor, the topmost entry is removed and if the queue is empty, the thread-local variable
 * will be cleaned up.
